```
/* KEY LEARNING POINTS
 * Global, function and block scope: Each is the child of the previous.
 * Block scope is defined by a statement then {};
 * let is different from var, it's strict to block scope when var is open to function scope.
 * when let is hoisted it isn't initalized with undefined like var. 
 * try {stuff throw "Custom error"} catch(error) {handle it} finally {no matter what do this}
