Learning from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/while-for), today I learned loops and switch statements.

[My notes.](https://codepen.io/jhancock532/pen/gqwgZL)

```
// KEY LEARNING POINTS
// - You don't need to use brackets for a single line for, if, or while statement.
// - If you define a variable in a for loop using var, it's accessible outside of the loop.
// - You can omit parts of the for loop deleration - for(;;) is an infinite loop.
// - Decreasing nesting improves code readability.
// - You can't use break or continue as part of a ? operator statement.
// - Breaks and continues only break from the inner loop, to break out of multiple loops you need to use loop labels.
// - If you ignore a break statement in a switch structure the code will continue on to run the next statement without any logical checks.
// - Both switches and cases can be arbitrary expressions.
// - The case switch structure uses strictly typed equality operations when comparing the argument to the case statements.
