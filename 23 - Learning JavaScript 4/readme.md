Learning from [http://javascript.info/](http://javascript.info/).

```
// // Key Learning Points
// CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Dart are languages built on JavaScript that get transpiled to JavaScript.
// Press Shift + Enter to enter multiple lines of JavaScript into the FireFox console.
// Put "use strict"; at the top of your code!
// <script type="" language="" ...> <-- Not necessary.
// The console object has a lot more functions than just log.
// The keyboard shortcut, crtl + / auto comments out lines of code (add shift for multiline).
// Hardcoded constants should be written in uppercase with underscores for spaces.
// Dynamically typed just means that variables can hold different types of input.
// Numbers include ints, floating point, Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
