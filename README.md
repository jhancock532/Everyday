# James Hancock
Hello world. I'm studying computer science with innovation at the University of Bristol: this year I'm part of several small teams working with industry clients, as well as completing conventional computer science units.

[Inspiration](#inspiration-&-strategy) : [Week One Reflection](week-one-reflection)

# Inspiration & Strategy
This project was [inspired by Beeple](https://vimeo.com/125524216), his attitude and creative work in equal measure.

*What is my definition of an everyday?*

> A digital creative project, either able to stand on its own or a clear section of a boarder creative project, that has been completed in one day before midnight. The work is completed when this repo is updated with the code and a tweet is posted to my Twitter account, including a link to the code and imagery of the result.

*How will I improve my skills through this project?*

# Week One Reflection
 - **My code quality isn't beautiful, but I can make it better.** I know what good code looks like, but I'm not consistently writing to that standard, often due to being in a rush to get the project done / lack of effort. This isn't an acceptable excuse - it is much better to code slowly and create a small project to build on and reuse later, than do a one off large project that nobody cares about.
 - **I'm spending too much time on these projects.** Next week I'll limit myself to one hour only per day. If I can't do a quick project, then I won't be able to sustain doing projects when I'm busier. I'm being too ambitious at the moment.
 - **I should learn the theory behind how to write good comments.** I'm sure I've seen an internet article or two about this, time to read a few and practice better commentary. This can be my project for day 8.
 - **Twitter is better than YouTube, don't spend too long on it though.** Through converting from YouTube to Twitter I'm discovering tonnes of cool resources. I like being able to support other people doing their everday projects, and there is plenty of inspiration to take from. The bigger the network of everyday folks that I can connect with, the better.
 - **Enough Bootstrap, jQuery is too easy.** Four of my projects have been based on Bootstrap, three of which with heavy jQuery use to make them interactive. Having a few demo sites like this which show I have basic knowledge of how to use Bootstrap/jQuery is useful. I'm ready to move on, I know these frameworks well enough now.
 - **The project I'm most proud of...** is the largest empty square pen. Visualising this algorithm looks super cool, and I got to learn some nice theory while implementing it. I'm definitely doing more algorithms focused pens.
 - **The project I'm least proud of...** is the first atomic design & german grammar tables pen. I wasn't able to implement DRY code, and used a lot of Bootstrap for my atomic and molecular components, so it doesn't really count. The result doesn't look good, and a German grammar teacher on Twitter saw it and helpfully pointed out that I'd been learning my tables the wrong way for three years.


## Day 7 - Beyond Duality - Generative Art
Click in the center of the circle to go beyond duality. The stamps represent peace & diligence. 
I'd say this is the first generative art piece I've made that works on any device size, no matter if you resize. I need to tidy up the work I've done to achieve this and then apply the technique to other projects.

## Day 6 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables II
The adventures with German grammar continue: you can now test yourself to see how much you've learned. 
From an atomic design perspective, I've developed a handful of organisms, but I really need to use Jekyll or similar to stop copying and pasting them. Perhaps a good step forward is to start messing with Jekyll again? I guess this is a possibility when I finish this month and move outside of CodePen. I'll keep exploring, reading and trying new things in the meantime.

## Day 5 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables I

I'm learning the basics of atomic design and polishing up on my German grammar at the same time. I'm exploring how I can put the design principles behind atomic design into practice - I haven't read chapter three of the online e-book yet, so I don't have any preconceived notions about best practice. Reading the next two chapters today and resuming development tomorrow.

## Day 4 - Bristol SU Sex & Relationships Survey Results (Interactive!)

An interactive survey results website, built with Bootstrap, jQuery and chart.js. This format of interactive survey, where your answer is highlighted in contrast to others, highlights self comparison, which I don't really like. The instant feedback of results feels like taking an online test, where you could have picked the wrong answer. And it has too much text.

Adding precise numbers of people who are like you, both in the survey and extrapolated out into the general student population, has a slightly more positive effect - you can clearly see you aren't the only one who has picked an option, so you aren't that different to others. The animations and bootstrap styles are alright.

## Day 2 - Abstract Website Generator
Creates a cat-themed, abstract website, built on Bootstrap and jQuery. You can tweak three parameters in the options to get a different result, or simply regenerate a new site with the Create Website button.
