# Hello world
This project was [inspired by Beeple](https://vimeo.com/125524216), his attitude and creative work in equal measure.

*What is my definition of an everyday?*

> A digital creative project, either able to stand on its own or a clear section of a boarder creative project, that has been completed in one day before midnight. The work is completed when this repo is updated with the code and a tweet is posted to my Twitter account, including a link to the code and imagery of the result.

## Day 7 - Beyond Duality - Generative Art
Click in the center of the circle to go beyond duality. The stamps represent peace & diligence. 
I'd say this is the first generative art piece I've made that works on any device size, no matter if you resize. I need to tidy up the work I've done here and then apply the technique to other projects.

## Day 6 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables II
The adventures with German grammar continue: you can now test yourself to see how much you've learned. 
From an atomic design perspective, I've developed a handful of organisms, but I really need to use Jekyll or similar to stop copying and pasting them. Perhaps a good step forward is to start messing with Jekyll again? I guess this is a possibility when I finish this month and move outside of CodePen. I'll keep exploring, reading and trying new things in the meantime.

## Day 5 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables I

I'm learning the basics of atomic design and polishing up on my German grammar at the same time. I'm exploring how I can put the design principles behind atomic design into practice - I haven't read chapter three of the online e-book yet, so I don't have any preconceived notions about best practice. Reading the next two chapters today and resuming development tomorrow.

## Day 4 - Bristol SU Sex & Relationships Survey Results (Interactive!)

An interactive survey results website, built with Bootstrap, jQuery and chart.js. This format of interactive survey, where your answer is highlighted in contrast to others, highlights self comparison, which I don't really like. The instant feedback of results feels like taking an online test, where you could have picked the wrong answer. And it has too much text.

Adding precise numbers of people who are like you, both in the survey and extrapolated out into the general student population, has a slightly more positive effect - you can clearly see you aren't the only one who has picked an option, so you aren't that different to others. The animations and bootstrap styles are alright.

## Day 2 - Abstract Website Generator
Creates a cat-themed, abstract website, built on Bootstrap and jQuery. You can tweak three parameters in the options to get a different result, or simply regenerate a new site with the Create Website button.
