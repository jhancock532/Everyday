# Hello world
This project was [inspired by Beeple](https://vimeo.com/125524216), his attitude and creative work in equal measure.

*What is my definition of an everyday?*

> A digital creative project, either able to stand on its own or a clear section of a boarder creative project, that has been completed in one day before midnight. The work is completed when this repo is updated with the code and a tweet is posted to my Twitter account, including a link to the code and imagery of the result.

## Day 2 - Abstract Website Generator
Creates a cat-themed, abstract website, built on Bootstrap and jQuery. You can tweak three parameters in the options to get a different result, or simply regenerate a new site with the Create Website button.
