[Inspiration](#inspiration-and-strategy) : [Week One Reflection](#week-one-reflection)

# Inspiration and Strategy
This project was [inspired by Beeple](https://vimeo.com/125524216), he's pretty cool.

*What is my definition of an everyday?*

> A digital creative project, either able to stand on its own or a clear section of a boarder creative project, that has been completed in one day before midnight. The work is completed when this repo is updated with the code and a tweet is posted to my Twitter account, including a link to the code and imagery of the result.

*How will I improve my skills through this project?*

> I'll perform regular weekly reflections on the work I completed in the past week. These shall be focusing on what projects worked well and what didn't work so well. I'll also be looking at the skills I employed within the projects - do I think I've improved in these areas? How will I test my skills to see what I've learned? What skills am I currently lacking as a developer?

## Day 15 - What's Your Favourite Colour? Internet Survey

Did a codepen challenge :o Tried out serverless(?) coding for the first time. It's not a very robust solution. Man I need to learn more about Javascript.

# Week Two Reflection
- **The internet is full of possibilities.** A friend recently introduced me to [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) a super cool website filled with awesome projects, all hosted for free! Next month I'm going to be making projects on this site, to change things up from CodePen.
- **Splitting projects into chunks is a good idea, as a good creative result takes time.** Let's face it, "Learning to Paint I" and a bunch of other projects this week look terrible. The best projects are the end results of those which I've split into parts and built on over several days. To quote Wordburglar - *"Good things take time, like a watch repossessor."* I have to accept this and not be so impatient in expecting excellent results.
- **Don't let Twitter gratification hold you back: this is bigger than getting likes or followers.** I've got to stop caring so much about the number of Twitter followers, likes or retweets I'm getting, because I'm starting to get validation from these numbers. That validation leads to addiction. I have a conflict between creating stuff which looks good for the Twitter account and making good headway on a coding project or expanding coding skills. It doesn't help that everyday I have to tweet a link to the code and the imagery of the result, as per my original everyday strategy.
- **It takes a lot of time to learn how to code, and I'm really only just starting.** Only considering the long term will I achieve any lasting success. I must suffer the pain of loosing followers from posting unattractive work in the short term if in the long term it improves my overall skillset and creative results. Working through this in my head has helped me discount the value of twitter followers and external gratification, although this is something I'll have to be careful of a lot in the future. Next week I shall commit to going on Twitter only once a day, when I release everyday details.
- **You have to make pragmatic decisions while coding.**
> "It's courageous developers like Ada, who not only try things out but who share their code and document their process that helps us all appreciate, that everyone, no matter their skill level or experience, have to make pragmatic choices when coding." [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/culture/the-cutting-edge-of-the-web-with-ada-rose-cannon/)
My attempt on day 8 to make the windows popup taught me this, then I learned it properly on day 9. Being limited for time = pragmatic coding.

## Day 14 - Particle System Template II
It's good to finish a project. I'm relatively happy with the standard of code in this one, I think it's good enough. 

End of week 2! *Nice.*

<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## Day 13 - Particle System Template I
I'm noticing a pattern in how I'm creating some generative art projects - a central simulation class, which holds all the particles and their settings, and then the particle class. This project is an attempt at creating a basic template which has all the essentials for a particle simulation in it. 

The gravity / physics simulation isn't quite right yet, but I like how I'm taking in the dat.GUI object to do all the settings assignment inside the ParticleSystem class - it's nice to be able to encapsulate everything. Those multiline code comments above the functions are super neat, I should add more.

Things I want to try out:
- [webtask.io](https://webtask.io/docs/) for serverless programming sounds **awesome**.
- Get Learning to Paint to do a sketch of a person. 
- Tidy up this project for easy reuse & better default physics. 
- Project Euler. "The programming right of passage"
- Learn a bit of React.

## Day 12 - Learning To Paint III
Most of today was spent fixing the maths of yesterday. Everything seems in order now, tomorrow is more parameter fiddling and then development of the Painting class - hopefully!

<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## Day 11 - Learning To Paint II

Developing with a much better flow today. Limited to one hour without qualms, spent at least 20 mins afterwards messing with parameters and watching the results. Making consistent progress, and code quality is steadily increasing. I learned today about the awesomeness of adding really subtle vignettes.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="35659" data-slug-hash="aPRezQ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jhancock532" data-pen-title="Learning to Paint II" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/jhancock532/pen/aPRezQ/">Learning to Paint II</a> by James Hancock (<a href="https://codepen.io/jhancock532">@jhancock532</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## Day 10 - Learning To Paint I

It's day three of limiting myself to one hour, and I decided to go about it in a slightly different way - today is part of a much larger project, so I don't have to finish everything in one go. Much more sensible. This is probably how most programmers do it in real life.

The good news is that my code quality has improved a bit now I'm not rushing for time, and I've got a better sense of where to add comments from reading a few guides on it. I've finally started to use the ```class``` constructor in this project, hopefully in two days I'll get to try learning Javascript inheritance as I create a new brush based off the old one. Something new to learn!

## Day 9 - Remembering Interview Questions

After yesterday's disaster of limiting myself to one hour, I decided to do it again. I failed to fully complete the project to the standard I was hoping, but I think I'm improving slightly. I'm learning about the importance of prioritisation and planning - without it, you won't have a complete project by the time it comes to stop. Making design scarifices because of lack of time is definitely an interesting experience, as I usually work until completion. I think I've given myself a good less ambitious project to solve, but it was still not quite possible to do in the hour. The code quality and commenting is still doing quite badly - this is an area I really need to improve in. I'm reading into it tonight.

## Day 8 - Windows Error Message Pop-Up

I limited myself to one hour to complete this pen - I think I'd need at least twice that to do it properly. I wasted around 10 mins trying to get my imported font to work (it still doesn't). The rest of the time was spent productively, ish - 10 mins on the initial layout and structure of the HTML, and 40 mins of CSS tweaking and constant googling of how to CSS.

The result is poor CSS code structure, nightmare of id tags in the HTML section, and a fire gif where there should be a windows warning icon. I don't think I'll limit myself to only one hour again. 

This has been a great learning experience to reflect on however... 
- You can't rush quality code
- I'm still being far too ambitious with my projects
- Constantly requiring to Google things is limiting my productivity
- A single bug can screw over development quite a lot if you let it
- I really don't know CSS that well, but I guess I know it well enough that I can Google the right things for a passable result
- Finding approprate assests and preparing them for a creative project takes more time than you think
- I just refreshed my memory on a whole bunch of CSS styling in an hour

# Week One Reflection
 - **My code quality isn't beautiful, but I can make it better.** I know what good code looks like, but I'm not consistently writing to that standard, often due to being in a rush to get the project done / lack of effort. This isn't an acceptable excuse - it is much better to code slowly and create a small project to build on and reuse later, than do a one off large project that nobody cares about.
 - **I'm spending too much time on these projects.** Next week I'll limit myself to one hour only per day. If I can't do a quick project, then I won't be able to sustain doing projects when I'm busier. I'm being too ambitious at the moment.
 - **I should learn the theory behind how to write good comments.** I'm sure I've seen an internet article or two about this, time to read a few and practice better commentary. This can be my project for day 8.
 - **Twitter is better than YouTube, don't spend too long on it though.** Through converting from YouTube to Twitter I'm discovering tonnes of cool resources. I like being able to support other people doing their everday projects, and there is plenty of inspiration to take from. The bigger the network of everyday folks that I can connect with, the better.
 - **Enough Bootstrap, jQuery is too easy.** Four of my projects have been based on Bootstrap, three of which with heavy jQuery use to make them interactive. Having a few demo sites like this which show I have basic knowledge of how to use Bootstrap/jQuery is useful. I'm ready to move on, I know these frameworks well enough now.
 - **The project I'm most proud of...** is the largest empty square pen. Visualising this algorithm looks super cool, and I got to learn some nice theory while implementing it. I'm definitely doing more algorithms focused pens.
 - **The project I'm least proud of...** is the first atomic design & german grammar tables pen. I wasn't able to implement DRY code, and used a lot of Bootstrap for my atomic and molecular components, so it doesn't really count. The result doesn't look good, and a German grammar teacher on Twitter saw it and helpfully pointed out that I'd been learning my tables the wrong way for three years.


## Day 7 - Beyond Duality - Generative Art
Click in the center of the circle to go beyond duality. The stamps represent peace & diligence. 
I'd say this is the first generative art piece I've made that works on any device size, no matter if you resize. I need to tidy up the work I've done to achieve this and then apply the technique to other projects.

## Day 6 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables II
The adventures with German grammar continue: you can now test yourself to see how much you've learned. 
From an atomic design perspective, I've developed a handful of organisms, but I really need to use Jekyll or similar to stop copying and pasting them. Perhaps a good step forward is to start messing with Jekyll again? I guess this is a possibility when I finish this month and move outside of CodePen. I'll keep exploring, reading and trying new things in the meantime.

## Day 5 - Atomic Design & German Grammar Tables I

I'm learning the basics of atomic design and polishing up on my German grammar at the same time. I'm exploring how I can put the design principles behind atomic design into practice - I haven't read chapter three of the online e-book yet, so I don't have any preconceived notions about best practice. Reading the next two chapters today and resuming development tomorrow.

## Day 4 - Bristol SU Sex & Relationships Survey Results (Interactive!)

An interactive survey results website, built with Bootstrap, jQuery and chart.js. This format of interactive survey, where your answer is highlighted in contrast to others, highlights self comparison, which I don't really like. The instant feedback of results feels like taking an online test, where you could have picked the wrong answer. And it has too much text.

Adding precise numbers of people who are like you, both in the survey and extrapolated out into the general student population, has a slightly more positive effect - you can clearly see you aren't the only one who has picked an option, so you aren't that different to others. The animations and bootstrap styles are alright.
