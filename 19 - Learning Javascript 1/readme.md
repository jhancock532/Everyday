Alright, this might be the first of many. 

I followed the blog post at

My code and notes at

 ```
 /* KEY LEARNING POINTS
 * - JSON.stringify and JSON.parse are pretty useful.
 * - You can delete, iterate through and test the existance of properties. 
 * - delete obj.property, if ("property" in object), object.hasOwnProperty...
 * - You can only iterate through enumerable properties. use "for (var ... in ...)"
 * - Properties are inherited from the prototype (Might be an oversimplification...)
