An interactive survey results website, built with Bootstrap, jQuery and chart.js. The site plays off the tropes of taking a survey, and then getting instant feedback as if you're completing an online test.

This format of interactive survey, where your answer is highlighted in contrast to others, highlights self comparison, which isn't always advisable. 

Adding precise numbers of people who are like you, both in the survey and extrapolated out into the general student population, has a slightly more positive effect - you can clearly see you aren't the only one who has picked an option, so you aren't that different to others.
