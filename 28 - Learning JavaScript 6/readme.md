```
// KEY LEARNING POINTS
// - String comparisions are based on unicode and matching up letters.
// - "", null, undefined, NaN, 0 and false are falsy values.
// - The rest are all truthy values.
// - You can nest ternary (conditional operators) to create switch like statments.
// - A chain of || will return the first truthy value, reading left to right.
// - If no truthy values, the last value is returned. Can be used for short curcuit evaluation.
// - Chained && has a similar property, except it returns the first falsy value.
// - The precedence of && is higher than that of ||, and ! is higher than both.
// - A double ! or !! can be used to convert values to Boolean, but I prefer Boolean(value).
