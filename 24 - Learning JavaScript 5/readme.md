Just covering the basics, nothing really interesting today, but kinda useful I guess.

The notes are [here](https://codepen.io/jhancock532/pen/WPQejX?editors=0010).

- Started learning from https://javascript.info/types
- Then https://javascript.info/operators
- Finally https://javascript.info/comparison

KEY LEARNING POINTS
- Exponentiation happens with **. Use as a shorthand for Math.sqrt! 16 ** (1/2) = 4
- Strings with backticks `` allow expression insertion, e.g. `1 + 2 = ${1 + 2}`
- Strict equality operator === checks if items are equal without type conversion
- null and undefined have there own types, but they equal with ==
- A lot of operators auto convert elements to the right type, "6"/"3" === 2
- Use Boolean(), Number() and String() to convert primitive types.
- Operators have precedence and assoiation rules. a = b = 3 -> a = 3
- Unary + operator converts the type to Number. +"8" === 8
- Prefix ++a increments then assigns, unlike a++ which is lazy
