I'm learning the basics of atomic design and polishing up on my German grammar at the same time.

-- Most atomic elements are styled by Bootstrap - these include inputs, table cells, text items, and other essential HTML elements.
-- Molecules include table rows and Bootstrap layout systems.
-- Organisms that I've built include...
  -- A simple header, table and description.
  -- Header, two tables, description.
  -- Two tables side by side.
  -- Header, input table, submit button.
-- Templates and pages haven't been considered in great detail, as I complete the basics these will become more prominent.

This site's development is based off reading http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/ - it's going to be project over several days as I learn more about how atomic design works.
